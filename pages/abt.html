<h1>Our Company</h1>

<p>
    Viktuuri & Co. is an upcoming software and hardware development company popular due to its release of the Antonio Iras AI Bot. The founders of Viktuuri & Co. were the patented developers of Antonio Iras : Will Shakespear, Ernie Hemmie, Nest Way, Scott Fitz, Gorge Oar, Alfred Hux, John Salinge, Len Tolstoy, and James Joy. Excepting Mr. Len Tolstoy, all other developers currently run Viktuuri & Co. 
</p>

<p>
	Specializing in software development, Viktuuri & Co. has recently partnered with Leoji Robotics to produce hardware to support and upgrade their software development. Thanks to this collaboration, Viktuuri & Co. is now releasing their first, portable hardware for use with any computer with compatible HDMI or UBS ports.
</p>

<p>
	On the horizon, Viktuuri & Co. looks to developing the programming language of TSA (Technology and Service Alphabet) to improve upon existing software, as well as develop new software.
</p>
		
		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		
		<p>Viktuuri & Co. was started by two immigrants from England that took their residence in the Philadelphia metropolitan area due to the large number of job opportunities for programmers. They met during a dual-company project when working for the Union Pacific railroad line on a project based in Omaha, Nebraska.  Will Shakespear and Alfred Hux partnered with Hux’s long-time friend Gorge Oar to begin their company : Viktuuri & Co. Their first product was the rudimentary model of AntonioIras, titled Cordelia. </p>
	<p>Their first office was based in Philadelphia at the same location where the current office is. They extended their branch to Omaha, Nebraska in honor of the Union Pacific project that initiated the company. There, Shakespear, Hux, and Oar met with other leading software engineers working for PS Technology : Ernie Hemmie, Nest Way, and Scott Fitz. From there, the company extended into New York City with their office located in Manhattan. The company grew to include other leading members, such as John Salinge. By extending the branch into England, the company gained international recognition for its up-and-coming software development team, which by then included ; Will Shakespear, Alfred Hux, Gorge Oar, Ernie Hemmie, Nest Way, Scott Fitz, John Salinge, and James Joy. Viktuuri & Co. has maintained their same management team throughout the entirety of its running wit Will Shakespear as CEO of Viktuuri & Co. </p>
	<p>AntonioIras was developed in tandem from early 2010 to late 2017, using Cordelia as the base model. During development, engineers and programmers surveyed over a thousand people to find their interests in an AI program. Winning this survey were the Relevancy and Intelligence categories. AntonioIras was, then, designed as such and marketed starting late 2017.</p>
	<p>In mid 2016, Viktuuri & Co. partnered with Leoji Robotics to introduce hardware to partner with the AntonioIras AI unit. Marketed starting early 2018, Viktuuri & Co. and Leoji are officially in an indefinite partnership, bringing hardware and software together.</p>

	<p>Viktuuri & Co. has expanded to be a multinational business, spanning all timezones of the United States, as well as the nations of England, France, Germany, Japan, and Spain. The company now looks to bringing career options to the South American nations of Columbia and Venezuela.</p>

	<p>Its next project looks to bringing AntonioIras onto a full network scale for businesses in the newly-designed, still-developing Winston.</p>
