<h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p class="question">
        Will my AI develop its own personality as I work with it?
    </p>
        <p class="list">
            Yes. Each AI has set algorithms to identify and match or compliment its user’s personality in accordance with personality tests such as the Myers-Briggs personality test. 
        </p>

<br><p class="question">
    What is the lifespan of my AI hardware?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    The lifespan of a typical AI hardware is anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five years as based on storage availability. The AI itself will run as long as its updates are renewed and compatible with the hardware : a projected thirty-five years as planned by software developers at Viktuuri & Co. However, Viktuuri & Co. cannot take responsibility for any malfunctions as caused by user error. 
    </p>

<br><p class="question">
    How frequent and reliable are the updates for the software?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    Updates for software can be expected to automatically renew every seven to nine months as per the schedule of developers. These updates cannot be found on the company and product website ; each AntonioIras product is designed to automatically connect to a developers’ interface to download updates, which occur off-screen. These updates can be turned off and selectively chosen, though they cannot be edited or manipulated. Updates are scheduled for the current software for up to thirty-five years.
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    My AI stopped responding to my voice commands ; how do I fix this?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    Under settings, there is a menu for ‘Command Controls.’ In this pop-up window, there is a tab for ‘Voice Controls.’ Under the tab, there should be controls for different mechanisms of voice controls. Check that ‘Automatic Voice Recognition’ is selected as ‘Operating.’ If it is selected, then check ‘Sensitivity’ and, if needed, raise the sensitivity. If both solutions do not work, restart AntonioIras and wait five minutes before checking the settings and editing them to your preference. Be advised that restarting AntonioIras may reset some of its algorithms. If these measures still do not work, contact us with the email or phone number given under our website’s ‘Help’ page.
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    My AI went to update, but it lost its previous information database. How do I reverse this?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    When updating or first after being restarted, AntonioIras’s programs will take some time to properly reboot. This could mean that, for some hours not exceeding a full day, some functions of AntonioIras may be slow to restart. If the problem persists, revert temporarily to the latest update as can be selected in ‘Settings.’ Make sure that underneath the ‘Updates’ in ‘Settings,’ the selection ‘Retain Databases and Algorithms’ is selected before switching to the latest update.
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    I already bought the software for AntonioIras, but I want to buy the hardware in order to reduce the space the software takes up on my computer. Is there a way to buy the hardware without the software cost?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    There is not a way to purchase the AntonioIras hardware without the software pre-installed. However, one may overwrite the software on the hardware by simply copying and pasting the ‘Database’ folder from one’s pre-existing software folder under Program Files (x86). 
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">My AI seems to be missing information that it should have logged. How do I find missing files?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    If it occurs that one’s AntonioIras is missing files, ask your AI to search for the files according to keywords. Chances are that your AI accidentally filed it incorrectly. This should not be a common problem. If it is, ask your AI to present a list of keywords and the folders they are matched to. The AntonioIras system operates so that when working with certain subjects, the search system is largely limited to the folder it associates with the subject at task. Check that the AI has not assigned a keyword to an incorrect folder. There is also an option under ‘Settings’ that allows your AI to search through all folders regardless of keywords, though this may slow response.
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    My AI is not recording the outside information that I want it to. How do I alter its logging algorithms?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    Ask your AI to present the keywords, sites, and figures it is tracking. If something is missing, simply ask your AI to add it to the list. One may also ask its AI to update its logging so that every logged piece of data appears in the sidebar to ensure a way to track the logging. If something appears off, ask your AI to reorganize its logging according to your instructions.
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    Can I add programming languages to my AI software for the programmer’s model?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    Yes, though this takes time to accomplish. The easier option is to send a personalized request to Viktuuri & Co.’s developers ; be aware that, due to a large influx of requests, this may take anywhere from a month to half a year to process. The harder option is to manually work with one’s AI orally or through text to input the rules, restrictions, and tags of the language by which it will operate. Your AI will take some weeks to adjust to the additional language through a mixture of the user’s input and supplementary material it acquires through its own web searches and online libraries. 
    </p>
    
<br><p class="question">
    My AI is occupying a lot of my CPU usage, making my other programs lag. How do I fix this?
</p>
    <p class="list">
	    Under the ‘Settings’ tab, certain mechanisms of AntonioIras may be altered or turned off to reduce CPU usage. Another option is to work with one’s AI based on ‘Relevancy’ to have its work limited to the subject the user is currently running on. Background functions may also be turned off to reduce interference with other programs while the user does not have the AntonioIras interface pulled up.
