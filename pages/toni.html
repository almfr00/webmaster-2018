		<h1>Capabilities</h1>
		<p>AntonioIras is an AI ware that is designed to function as a secretary to any work environment, be it school, public centers, work, or home. The development of AntonioIras is credited to leading software engineering company Viktuuri & Co. and its chief engineers : Will Shakespear and Alfred Hux. Thanks to their visionary advancements in artificial intelligence, VIktuuri & Co. is proud to present AntonioIras.</p>
<p>AntonioIras functions on the coding language of TSA – Technology and Service Alphabet – as a spin-off language based on a mixture of languages including OWL and C++ as designed by Viktuuri & Co. coding expert Gorge Oar. By functioning on TSA, AntonioIras is able to respond to search requests and execute tasks as given. </p>
	<p>Logging is the primary feature of AntonioIras. According to keywords as inputted by the user to the AI figure, AntonioIras will routinely check statistics, figures, news stories, updates, and posts to the Internet in accordance to relevancy and organize them into viewing ‘packages’ that will appear on the navigation plane of the program’s window. The Database folder found under the program’s folder under Program Files (x86) is similarly organized, allowing for easy and quick organization in function as a working secretary.</p>
	<p>The secondary features of AntonioIras are query response and suggestion. AntonioIras is designed with two methods of input : via oral communication and via text communication. The program listens for the voice of the user and tracks its speech to determine whether or not the AI is being addressed ; when the AI considers itself to be addressed by the user, it will respond with necessary information and suggestion. The text input is found directly below the AI’s figure on the AntonioIras window. Here, the AI will respond either verbally or textually to the query inputted. Outside of having response summoned by the user, the AI will follow user speech and input and respond according to its algorithms with suggestions, observances, and corrections. This feature may be turned off.</p>
